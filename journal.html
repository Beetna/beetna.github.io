<p>This year I have made a code sketch and a person card in computer science. In addition, I am starting to build the very first draft of a website in Java. My code sketch was the first project I undertook in computer science 1 and I enjoyed it. The sketch was a pink figure rotating through three different axises, x, y and z. At first I had this figure spinning two dimensionally and transitioning back. However, after my lab with Ms. Josephs we both discovered that there was code to make it spin three dimensionally. Next I used the knowledge of CSS I had learned with the code sketch to create a person card. This card featured an elephant (one of my favorite animals) spinning and changing into the previous pink figure but in yellow. Although I followed a format Ms. Joesphs provided, I still learned a lot about code pen and different transition effects. If I was to do this again in a blank code pen, I believe I could make some equally interesting. I have some experience with website coding in HTML (Github pages), python and Java. This helped me during the explanation of javascript in sublime text, I have built a website before with HTML and incorporating javascript for some aspects of the website. I am very excited to begin this folder based connection to a GITHUB page and log different milestones in my computer science journey. I believe that labs with Ms. Joesphs will help me the most in Computer Science 1 this year. I have been making labs on a roughly weekly basis, these labs are very helpful to me. Whether I need to fix something in my code, I do not understand the previous lesson, or I simply want to expand my knowledge; these labs are helpful for me.

<p>This week my website started coming together. I built a password page so I could tidy everything up while still having a website people could visit. On the password page I included a countdown clock to the election, as election day is tommorow I am considering adding an effect when the timer reaches 0. W3 schools website was very useful in creating the countdown. The password box was made in Java script and basically gave a text box and a button. The code checks whether the password entered is correct, if yes then it takes you to another page of the website. If not it notifies you that you are incorrect.
